# 42 Pool Exercises

This repository contains all the exercises that I completed during the 42 piscine.
The piscine was an intensive programming bootcamp that challenged me to learn and apply fundamental programming concepts using the C language.
Each folder in this repository represents a different day of the piscine, and contains the exercises that were assigned for that day.
Inside each folder, you will find the source code files and any associated files or resources.
Feel free to explore my code and see my progress throughout the piscine.
I am constantly learning and improving, and welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my 42 piscine exercises!
